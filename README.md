The completion date is the first half of 2021.

Minimum Edit Distance - the minimum number of editing operations needed to transform one string into another:
- operation/insertion
- deletion
- substitution

Implemented a MED algorithm with a simple user interface, which is taken input as a ‘word’ and lists its first five alternative correct words (list nearest 5-words) using the dictionary given.

The MED value of transforming from the first to the second word was found for the given two, and the steps were shown in the table. The names of the operations that needed to be made were written.
